## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI** — installed automatically via `npx`
- **Android Studio** (for Android) or **Xcode** (for iOS)
- **Android SDK** with `ANDROID_HOME` set (see [Android setup](#android-setup) below)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adityabhalsod/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npx expo start
```

### Android Setup

Before building for Android, the SDK location must be configured. Do **one** of the following:

**Option A — Set environment variable (recommended, permanent):**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH"

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Option B — Create `local.properties` (per-project):**
```bash
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Android/Sdk" > android/local.properties
```

> **Note:** `android/local.properties` is git-ignored (machine-specific). Each developer needs to create it once.

### Running on a Device

```bash
# Android (requires Android Studio or connected device)
npx expo run:android

# iOS (requires Xcode on macOS)
npx expo run:ios

# Scan QR code with Expo Go app for quick preview
npx expo start
```

### Building for Production

Always clear all caches before a production build to ensure fresh assets and code:

```bash
# 1. expo prebuild for android.
npx expo prebuild --platform android --no-install

# 2. Clear all caches (Metro, Gradle, node_modules cache)
rm -rf android/app/build android/.gradle/build-cache node_modules/.cache /tmp/metro-* /tmp/haste-map-*
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# 3. Build release APK for Android
cd android && ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk ./gradlew app:assembleRelease -x lint -x test --configure-on-demand --build-cache
```

The release APK will be at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**iOS release build:**
```bash
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
```

> **First build note:** The initial release build compiles native C++ modules (reanimated, gesture-handler) and can take **10–15 minutes**. Subsequent builds use the Gradle cache and are much faster.

### CI/CD — Automated Releases

Pushing to specific branches triggers a GitHub Actions pipeline that builds a clean APK and publishes a GitHub Release automatically:

| Branch | Channel | Version Example | Pre-release |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `main` | **Stable** | `v1.0.0` | No |
| `beta` | **Beta** | `v1.0.0-beta.3` | Yes |
| `alpha` | **Alpha** | `v1.0.0-alpha.7` | Yes |

**What the pipeline does:**
1. Reads the base version from `app.json` → `expo.version`
2. Appends `-alpha.N` or `-beta.N` suffix based on the branch (commit count since last tag)
3. Cleans all Gradle caches and builds a fresh release APK (`--no-build-cache`)
4. Generates a categorized changelog from commit messages (features, fixes, performance, etc.)
5. Creates a Git tag, publishes a GitHub Release, and uploads the versioned APK as a downloadable asset

**Download releases:** [GitHub Releases →](https://github.com/adityabhalsod/expense-tracker/releases)

> **Tip:** Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`) so the changelog is categorized automatically.

> **Skip CI:** Add `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` anywhere in your commit message or PR title to skip the release pipeline for that push.
> ```bash
> git commit -m "docs: update readme [skip ci]"
> ```
